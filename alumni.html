                College is one of the memorable parts of a student's life whether it was about friends, professors or growth of life. We have to make so many decisions as it will make an impact on the career and future of one's life. I have been introvert and no knowledge about the business studies before entering the college as I was from a small town it was a whole new experience for me. My growth started from my college life and it would not be possible without such enthusiastic and professors who are masters of their field. I think I was the student with so many questions in every lecture but my professors were so supportive that they were ready to solve my queries even if I ask them 10th time. I have so many memories with every professor and those days I count as best days of my life. My professors Dr Himani Avasthi, Deepika Kalra, Anu Sharma, Kamal Batra, Neha Chauhan And Dr Chanda they were the life to our management department and I feel blessed for the learnings from them. I may not remember the content written in books but beyond them, they taught about how to fight in life and grow on different stages. Himani mam, HOD of our department, master of her subjects, a person full of values and audacity but I still remember her poem on teacher's day "Nani Teri Morni Ko Mor Le Gaya" she never failed to be part of us and cheering us. Deepika Mam, Her charming smile, we always feel scared from her if we have not completed the task given by her but still, she forgave us so many times, I still remember one lecture when she motivated us to do something beyond these books in life, Learn something new which can help your career, start some courses and that day changed my whole thinking. I just started a new course after one month of that day and I am blessed that I was present in that lecture which drove my whole career. Anu mam, I never saw her in anger in those 3 years, even if we haven't completed the task her reply was always "Very good". She was the sweetest professor of our branch. She teaches us so smoothly and elegantly that we could fall in love with accounts. Kamal Sir, The person who never gets bored from teaching, he too got frustrated so many times and left our class but he was in love with us and he can teach us non-stop full day. his energy and motivation, I still know some of my friends used to irritate him to the extent and he was always like, please study I am doing this only for you and your career. He always used to sing one song on every event of the department. His energy never faded away in those 3 years. Chanda Sir was always calm and we know we used to eat secretly our lunch in his lectures.

                WCTM is a self explanatory brand which defines the turned stone, ready to conquer the world. At WCTM I have lived the best days of my life. The experience here turned me to a more curious and achieving person. The support of the faculty members not only helped me to score good marks, but also helped me to overcome the flaws for being a good human being. With the grace of God and blessings of WCTM family, I was able to crack Campus Placements and now working with Mnc's .all was possible just because of WCTM.

                It would be difficult to sum up four years of WCTM in just few lines. I must say that the learning and exposure which WCTM gives is just commendable. The faculty is just amazing and they stand by you from the first day to the end of placement days.
                <br><br>
                Apart from the curriculum, there are a lot of clubs for students. The best part of college is that they give you internships and placements in best reputed organisations. During the most crucial time of placements, the faculty and placement team provides students with lot of preparatory sessions so that they come up with their best. I feel WCTM is the wholesome basket for one who is looking to pursue Bachelors in Technology and I'll definitely cherish these moments forever.
